# Snowbridge

[![Release][release-image]][releases]

## Overview

Snowbridge is a flexible, low latency tool which can replicate streams of data of any type to external destinations, optionally filtering or transforming the data along the way. It can be used to consume, transform and relay data from any supported source and to any supported destination, or any destination which supports HTTP.

See the [documention](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/destinations/forwarding-events/snowbridge/) for details on how to configure and run the application.
